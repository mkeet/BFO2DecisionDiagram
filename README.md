# BFO 2.0 Classifier

BFO 2.0 Classifier is an entity classifier that allows users to add entities to the correct category in the BFO foundational ontology. Users are required to answer a series of questions generated by the classifier and the resulting axiom can then be added to the ontology. The latest version is available from the folder named "BFO2Classifier2". A brief tutorial/description of its use is described at https://bfo-classifier.github.io/.  A screenshot of the tool in action:
